CONSTRUCTORS:
 - used in test, ie. each test creates a new instance of each object
 - Employee - the most basic example
 - - Different syntax to constructor example in first activity though
 - - Is this something to do with classes?
 - - Has variable properties (do these have a name?) and methods (function properties)
 - -  Also worth noting it uses the 'this.' property.

 PROTOTYPES: 
 - The .prototype. property isn't used anywhere in Team Profile Builder - either have to include or find elsewhere; also worth doing research task #2. 
 - This is sort of what the 'inheritance' tests seem to test for though? Maybe could explain that!
